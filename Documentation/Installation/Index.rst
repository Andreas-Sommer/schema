   The extension is available for TYPO3 9 LTS.

The recommended way to install this extension is by using Composer. In your Composer-based TYPO3 project root, just type

   composer req brotkrueml/schema

and the latest stable release will be installed.

But you can also install the extension from the TYPO3 Extension Repository (TER).

The Extension Configuration offers some basic configuration which is explained in the :ref:`Configuration <Configuration>` chapter.
