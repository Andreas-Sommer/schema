What does it do?
================

Structured data is essential for search engine optimisation nowadays. This extension allows the easy integration of
structured data based on the `schema.org vocabulary <https://schema.org/>`__ on a TYPO3 website. A good introduction to the topic is provided
by Google: `Understand how structured data works <https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/intro-structured-data>`__.

The structured data is embedding on a web page in `JSON-LD <https://json-ld.org/>`__ encoding and can be checked with
Google's `Structured Data Testing Tool <https://search.google.com/structured-data/testing-tool>`__.

Current limitations
===================

For now, only accepted terms are available, `pending types and properties <https://pending.schema.org/>`__
are not available yet. But if they are integrated into the core vocabulary, they are available within the next update.
